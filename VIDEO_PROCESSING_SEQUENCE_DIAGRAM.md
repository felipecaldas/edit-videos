## 📋 API Endpoints Reference

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/orchestrate/start` | POST | Create new video processing job |
| `/orchestrate/status/{run_id}` | GET | Check workflow status (via Temporal UI). Note: Direct video download endpoint is removed as files are accessed via shared volume. |
| `{VIDEO_COMPLETED_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL}` | POST | N8N receives job completion/failure notifications |

## 💾 Data Flow

### Temporal Server:
- Stores all workflow state, history, and outcomes.
- Manages task queues for workflows and activities.

### File System:
- `/data/shared/{run_id}/` - Run working directory
- `final_video.mp4` - Final video file
- `voiceover.mp3` - Audio file
- `manifest.json` - The initial payload for the workflow run.

## 🔄 Processing Pipeline

Temporal orchestrates the entire pipeline using a parent/child workflow model for enhanced robustness and resumability.

1.  **Parent Workflow (`VideoGenerationWorkflow`)**: 
    - Initiated by the `/orchestrate/start` endpoint.
    - Executes initial setup activities like `setup_run_directory` and `generate_voiceover` (if enabled).

2.  **Child Workflows (`ProcessSceneWorkflow`)**:
    - The parent workflow loops through each prompt and starts a separate `ProcessSceneWorkflow` for each one.
    - Each child workflow is responsible for a single scene and executes its own activities: `generate_image`, `upload_image_for_video_generation`, and `generate_video_from_image`.
    - **This is the key to resumability**: If a single scene fails, only its corresponding child workflow is retried.

3.  **Finalization (Parent Workflow)**:
    - The parent workflow waits for all child workflows to complete.
    - It then collects the results and runs the final activities: `stitch_videos` and `burn_subtitles_into_video`.

4.  **Notification**: The parent workflow calls the `send_completion_webhook` activity to notify N8N of the final status.
