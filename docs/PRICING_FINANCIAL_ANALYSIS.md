### 2.2 REVISED Pricing Strategy (Profitable Model)

Given the actual production costs, here are three pricing options:

#### **Option A: Premium Pricing (High Margin)**

| Tier | Price | Videos/Month | Cost | Gross Margin | Margin % |
|------|-------|--------------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $99/month | 10 videos | $21 | $78 | 79% |
| **Creator** | $349/month | 40 videos | $85 | $264 | 76% |
| **Professional** | $999/month | 120 videos | $254 | $745 | 75% |
| **Enterprise** | $2,499/month | 350 videos | $742 | $1,757 | 70% |

**Target Gross Margin:** 70-79% (premium positioning)  
**Advantage:** Maximum profitability, strong unit economics  
**Risk:** May be too expensive for early adopters

#### **Option B: Competitive Pricing (Market Entry)**

| Tier | Price | Videos/Month | Cost | Gross Margin | Margin % |
|------|-------|--------------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $49/month | 10 videos | $21 | $28 | 57% |
| **Creator** | $149/month | 40 videos | $85 | $64 | 43% |
| **Professional** | $399/month | 120 videos | $254 | $145 | 36% |
| **Enterprise** | $999/month | 350 videos | $742 | $257 | 26% |

**Target Gross Margin:** 26-57% (competitive positioning)  
**Advantage:** Lower barrier to entry, faster customer acquisition  
**Risk:** Lower margins, less room for CAC

#### **Option C: Hybrid Model (RECOMMENDED)** ⭐

| Tier | Base Price | Included Videos | Cost | Margin | Margin % | Overage Price |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------|--------|----------|---------------|
| **Starter** | $79/month | 10 videos | $21 | $58 | 73% | $6/video |
| **Creator** | $249/month | 40 videos | $85 | $164 | 66% | $5/video |
| **Professional** | $699/month | 120 videos | $254 | $445 | 64% | $4/video |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Custom | Variable | Variable | 60%+ | $3/video |

**Why This Works:**
- **Excellent margins:** 64-73% gross margin
- **Predictable revenue** from base subscription
- **Overage incentive:** Lower per-video cost at higher tiers
- **Competitive positioning:** Premium but not excessive
- **Room for CAC:** Can spend $50-150 per customer acquisition
- **Scalable:** Heavy users are still profitable
